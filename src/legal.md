**6.2	Security Standards.** To protect from unauthorized access,  all Customer Data, both at rest and in transport , is encrypted. All Service Provider web connections utilize TLS v1.2.

In connection with the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, Service Provider will provide reasonable assistance to Customer in order to enable and facilitate an orderly transition of the Services to Customer or to another vendor.

SERVICE PROVIDER HAS NO OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS, ALTERATION, DESTRUCTION, DAMAGE, CORRUPTION OR RECOVERY OF CUSTOMER DATA.

Customer shall not, and shall not permit any Authorized User or other Person to, provide any Prohibited Data to, or Process any Prohibited Data through, the Services, the Service Provider Systems or any Service Provider Personnel.

**12.1	Service Provider Indemnification.** Service Provider shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer and Customer's officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns (each, a "Customer Indemnitee") from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Customer Indemnitee arising out of or relating to any claim, suit, action or proceeding (each, an "Action") by a third party (other than an Affiliate of a Customer Indemnitee) to the extent that such Losses arise from any allegation in such Action that Customer's or an Authorized User's use of the Services (excluding Customer Data and Third Party Materials) in compliance with this Agreement (including the Specifications) infringes a U.S. Intellectual Property Right. The foregoing obligation does not apply to any Action or Losses arising out of or relating to any: 

1.	 	access to or use of the Services or Service Provider Materials in combination with any hardware, system, software, network or other materials or service not provided or authorized in the Specifications or otherwise in] writing by Service Provider;

2.	modification of the Services or Service Provider Materials other than: (i) by or on behalf of Service Provider; or (ii) with Service Provider's written approval in accordance with Service Provider's written specification;

3.	failure to timely implement any modifications, upgrades, replacements or enhancements made available to Customer by or on behalf of Service Provider; or

4.	act, omission or other matter described in Section 12.2(a), Section 12.2(b), Section 12.2(c) or Section 12.2(d), whether or not the same results in any Action against or Losses by any Service Provider Indemnitee.

**12.2	Customer Indemnification.** Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Service Provider and its Subcontractors and Affiliates, and each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each, a "Service Provider Indemnitee") from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Service Provider Indemnitee in connection with any Action by a third party (other than an Affiliate of a Service Provider Indemnitee) to the extent that such Losses arise out of or relate to any: 

1.	Customer Data, including any Processing of Customer Data by or on behalf of Service Provider in accordance with this Agreement;

2.	any other materials or information (including any documents, data, specifications, software, content or technology) provided by or on behalf of Customer or any Authorized User, including Service Provider's compliance with any specifications or directions provided by or on behalf of Customer or any Authorized User to the extent prepared without any contribution by Service Provider; 

3.	allegation of facts that, if true, would constitute Customer's breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement; or

4.	negligence or more culpable act or omission (including recklessness or willful misconduct) by Customer, any Authorized User, or any third party on behalf of Customer or any Authorized User, in connection with this Agreement. 

**12.3	Indemnification Procedure.** Each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any Action for which such party believes it is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section 12.1 or Section 12.2, as the case may be. The party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnitee") shall cooperate with the other party (the "Indemnitor") at the Indemnitor's sole cost and expense. The Indemnitor shall immediately take control of the defense and investigation of such Action and shall employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to handle and defend the same, at the Indemnitor's sole cost and expense. The Indemnitee's failure to perform any obligations under this Section 12.3 will not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this Section 12 except to the extent that the Indemnitor can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnitee may participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing.

**12.4	Mitigation.** If any of the Services or Service Provider Materials are, or in Service Provider's opinion are likely to be, claimed to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any third-party Intellectual Property Right, or if Customer's or any Authorized User's use of the Services or Service Provider Materials is enjoined or threatened to be enjoined, Service Provider may, at its option and sole cost and expense: 

1.	obtain the right for Customer to continue to use the Services and Service Provider Materials materially as contemplated by this Agreement; 

2.	modify or replace the Services and Service Provider Materials, in whole or in part, to seek to make the Services and Service Provider Materials (as so modified or replaced) non-infringing, while providing materially equivalent features and functionality, in which case such modifications or replacements will constitute Services and Service Provider Materials, as applicable, under this Agreement; or 

3.	by written notice to Customer, terminate this Agreement and require Customer to immediately cease any use of the Services and Service Provider Materials or any specified part or feature thereof.

THIS SECTION 12 SETS FORTH CUSTOMER'S SOLE REMEDIES AND SERVICE PROVIDER'S SOLE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION FOR ANY ACTUAL, THREATENED OR ALLEGED CLAIMS THAT THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF (INCLUDING THE SERVICES AND SERVICE PROVIDER MATERIALS) INFRINGES, MISAPPROPRIATES OR OTHERWISE VIOLATES ANY THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT.

**15.1	Further Assurances.** Upon a party's reasonable request, the other party shall, at the requesting party's sole cost and expense, execute and deliver all such documents and instruments, and take all such further actions, necessary to give full effect to this Agreement.

**15.2	Relationship of the Parties.** The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture or other form of joint enterprise, employment or fiduciary relationship between the parties, and neither party shall have authority to contract for or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.

**15.3	Public Announcements.** Neither party shall issue or release any announcement, statement, press release or other publicity or marketing materials relating to this Agreement or otherwise use the other party's trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names or other indicia of source, affiliation or sponsorship, in each case, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided, however, that Service Provider may, without Customer's consent, include Customer's name and logo in its lists of Service Provider's current or former customers of Service Provider in promotional and marketing materials.

**15.4	Notices/Language.** All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and other communications under this Agreement have binding legal effect only if in writing and addressed to a party to the address set forth above (or to such other address or such other person that such party may designate from time to time in accordance with this Section 15.4). Notices will be deemed given on the date received. All communications and notices made or given under this Agreement must be in the English language. If a translation of the English language version of this Agreement is provided to Customer, the English language version of the Agreement will control.

**15.5	Interpretation.** For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the words "include," "includes" and "including" are deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not exclusive; (c) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole; (d) words denoting the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice-versa; and (e) words denoting any gender include all genders. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Agreement: (x) to sections, exhibits, schedules, attachments and appendices mean the sections of, and exhibits, schedules, attachments and appendices attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof; and (z) to a statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes any successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. The parties intend this Agreement to be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted. The exhibits, schedules, attachments and appendices referred to herein are an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein.

**15.6	Headings.** The headings in this Agreement are for reference only and do not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

**15.7	Entire Agreement.** This Agreement, together with any other documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. 

**15.8	Assignment.** Customer shall not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer any of its obligations or performance, under this Agreement, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without Service Provider's prior written consent, which consent Service Provider shall not unreasonably withhold or delay. For purposes of the preceding sentence, and without limiting its generality, any merger, consolidation or reorganization involving Customer (regardless of whether Customer is a surviving or disappearing entity) will be deemed to be a transfer of rights, obligations or performance under this Agreement for which Service Provider's prior written consent is required. No delegation or other transfer will relieve Customer of any of its obligations or performance under this Agreement. Any purported assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this Section 15.8 is void. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

**15.9	No Third-party Beneficiaries.** This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

**15.10	Amendment and Modification; Waiver.** Service Provider reserves the right, at its discretion, to change or modify this Agreement at any time. If Service Provider makes material changes to this Agreement, Service Provider will provide Customer  with prominent notice of such changes as appropriate under the circumstances (e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Services or by sending Customer an email). Customer’s continued use of the Services after such notice will constitute Customer’s consent to the Agreement changes. If Customer does not wish to continue using the Services under the new version of the Agreement, Customer may terminate the Agreement by providing written notice to Service Provider. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. 

**15.11	Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to affect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

**15.12	Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.** This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of North Carolina without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of North Carolina. Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder shall be instituted in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of North Carolina in each case located in Wake County, North Carolina, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. Service of process, summons, notice or other document by mail to such party's address set forth herein shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or other proceeding brought in any such court. 

**15.13	Dispute Resolution.** Any dispute arising under the express terms of this Agreement or the grounds for termination of any rights granted under this Agreement shall be resolved as follows: First, within forty-five (45) days from one party’s written request to the other, senior executives of both parties shall meet to attempt to resolve such dispute. If the senior executives cannot resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days, either party may then make a written demand for arbitration by tendering to the other party notice of the dispute and its intent to invoke the terms of Section 15.14. 

**15.14	Arbitration.** The parties hereby agree to submit to mandatory binding arbitration any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of, relating to or connected with this Agreement or the Services provided to the Customer, including, but not limited to, claims of breach of contract (express or implied), breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, tort claims of any kind, claims based upon any federal, state or local ordinance, statute or regulation, and claims for compensation of any kind (the “Arbitrable Claims”).  Arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties.  Arbitration shall be the exclusive method by which to resolve all Arbitrable Claims, except that each party may, at its option, seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction related to the improper use, disclosure or misappropriation of a party’s private, proprietary, confidential or trade secret information.  Further, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties agree that no class or representative actions can be asserted in arbitration or otherwise.  All claims, whether in arbitration or otherwise, must be brought solely in the Service Provider’s or the Customer’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or collective proceeding.  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN REGARD TO ARBITRABLE CLAIMS. The parties agree that a neutral arbitrator from the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) will administer any such arbitration(s) in Cary, North Carolina.  The arbitrator shall issue a written decision with the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.  If, for any reason, any part or portion of this arbitration clause is held to be invalid or unenforceable, all other valid parts and portions shall be severable in nature, and remain fully enforceable.	

**15.15 	Equitable Relief.** Each party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such party of any of its obligations under Section 9 or, in the case of Customer, Section 3.3, Section 4.3 or Section 6.4, would cause the other party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise.

**15.16	Attorneys’ Fees.** In the event that any action, suit, or other legal or administrative proceeding is instituted or commenced by either party hereto against the other party arising out of or related to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs from the non-prevailing party.

**15.17	Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which is deemed an original, but all of which together are deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission is deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement.
