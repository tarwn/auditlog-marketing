Your privacy and the privacy you offer your customers is something we take very seriously.
This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect about you when you use the AuditLog 
service ([app.auditlog.co](https://app.auditlog.co)), access our website 
([www.auditlog.co](https://www.auditlog.co)), and support interactions over email and contact 
forms. Throughout this Privacy Policy, we'll collectively refer to these as the "Services".

What Personal Information We Collect
------------------------------------

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so, for example to provide
our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

### Information You Provide to Us

We collect the following information from you directly:

* **Basic Account Information**: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require each user of the service to have a username and email address.

* **Transaction and Billing Information**: We use a third party processor for all payments and may collect billing and contact information associated with transactions (but do not collect or process credit card information ourselves)

### Information We Collect Automatically

We also collect some information automatically:

* **Log Information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services that includes information about the logged in user, actions they are taking on the service, and additional information made available from browsers such as the browser type, IP Address, and the data and time of access. For example, when you authorize a new user to access your account.

* **Usage Information:** Like most online services, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, screen resolution, IP address, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of access. We use this information to get insights on how people use the Services so we can continue to improve them.

* **Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. AuditLog uses cookies for authentication and to remember user's settings. Cookies are also used by our partners to help collect the *Usage Information* identified above.

### Information We Collect From Other Sources

We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log
into your account through another service (like Google), we will receive information from 
that service (such as your username and basic profile information) via the authorization 
procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you 
authorize and any options that are available.

How We Use Personal Information
---------------------------------------

We use information about you as mentioned above and for the following purposes:

* To provide our Services: for example, to setup and maintain your account, authorize additional users from your Company, and protect access to your stored data
* To further develop and improve our Services: for example, by adding new features we think our users will find valuable
* To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services
* To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing: for example, analyzing how many users sign up for a plan after receiving a marketing message, or the features used by those that continue to use our Services after a certain length of time
* To communicate with you: for example through email when we detect a problem with the system or solicit feedback on your experience
* To troubleshoot performance issues you may experience with the system

### EU Data Protection

A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:

(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under our Terms of Service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account: for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or

(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or

(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or

(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information: for example, to provide and update our Services, to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to personalize your experience; or

(5) You have given us your consent

How We Share Your Personal Information
---------------------------------------

We do not sell our users' personal information.

However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties
as described in this section:

* **Anonymized Information:** We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to third party services for analysis and to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services.
* **Agents:** We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you).
* **To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:** We may disclose information about you to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of LaunchReady, our employees, our users, or others.
* **Aggregated Information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services on our marketing site.

How We Protect Your Personal Information
-------------------------------------------

The security of your personal information is important to us. We encrypt all transmissions
of information using secure layer technology (SSL) and encrypt that information at rest.

Your account is protected by a password for security. If you access your account via a third 
party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that 
third party site or service. 

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Your Rights
-----------------

If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of 
the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the "GDPR"), data protection laws 
give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided
 by the law, including the rights to:

* Request access to your personal data;
* Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
* Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
* Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
* Request portability of your personal data.

You can usually access and correct your personal data using your account settings
and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to do that, or you would like to contact
us about one of the other rights, you can submit a request to 
<a href="mailto://{{ email.privacy }}">{{ email.privacy }}</a>.

Data Transfer
-----------------

LaunchReady, LLC and the AuditLog Service are based in the United States. Personal 
Information that we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, any of our partners or 
service providers which may be inside or outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and 
Switzerland, including the United States. By submitting your personal data, you agree to 
such transfers. Your Personal Information may be transferred to countries that do not have
the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. 
When we transfer or disclose your Personal Information to other countries, we will protect 
that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Children's Privacy
--------------------

The Services are not directed to persons under 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware 
that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, 
he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto://{{ email.privacy }}">{{ email.privacy }}</a>. 
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 16. If we become 
aware that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete 
such information from our files.

Service Provider Collection
-----------------------------------

In addition to the activities described in this document, we may also process Personal
Information on behalf of our customers when they use the service. As a sub-processor of the 
data, we have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. 

Individuals seeking to access, correct, or delete personal information provided by our
customers should direct their query to that customer. We provide 
[self-service methods](http://localhost:8888/docs/supporting-privacy/) for our customers
to comply or a request to remove data can be submitted to 
<a href="mailto://{{ email.privacy }}">{{ email.privacy }}</a> and we will respond within 
30 days.

Privacy Policy Changes
-----------------------------------

Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change this Privacy Policy from time 
to time. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy
 Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in 
 some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or 
 sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the Services
 after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.
